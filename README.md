# A Parser for Invoices
 Based on Flex and Bison, we created a parser for date importing from invoices.
# Tutorial
- Thanks to the excellent [tutorial](https://aquamentus.com/flex_bison.html) privided by Chris verBurg!

- This tutorial explained __the functions of \*.y and \*.l files__ in details, and also provides useful instructions for __the usage of global variables and yyerror__.

- I strongly recommend a beginner of flex & bison to take a look at the [tutorial](https://aquamentus.com/flex_bison.html).

# Usage
1. Preparing your tools
 > install __Flex__ and __Bison__: input 'sudo apt-get install flex bison'
 > install __make__ if necessary: input 'sudo apt-get install make' (I have upload a Makefile for Ubuntu)
2. Downloading the source code
 > 'clone' this repository or simply download the zip file from this page.
